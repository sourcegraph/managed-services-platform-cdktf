	// This is computed as: weight/Sum(weights in this destination list). For non-zero values, there may be some epsilon from the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an implementation supports.
	// If only one serviceName is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100% of the traffic is forwarded to that backend.
	// If weights are specified for any one service name, they need to be specified for all of them.
	// If weights are unspecified for all services, then, traffic is distributed in equal proportions to all of them.
